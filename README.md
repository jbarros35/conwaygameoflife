# Conway Game of Life IOS

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.[1]


## Getting Started

This game follow the rules based on Conway's original Game of life

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Place your creatures into cells, play the button and watch amazing patterns forming.

If game world is empty cells the game ends whith a message.
If after 5 generations, game detects the same patterns repeating it stops and will not continue if there isn't any evolution on the creatures.
